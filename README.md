It is a simple Vue.js project that if we click Play Button, then it’s gonna wait a second or two until a green box appears as soon as it appears you have to click it as fast as you can then the rank and score is depends on speed of our click.

There are 3 components in this project:

App.vue – root component

Block.vue – Component that flashes the screen and that we have to click as quickly as we can and once we’ve done that,we show  the Results.vue component.

Results.vue – Component where we will display the result and rank.
